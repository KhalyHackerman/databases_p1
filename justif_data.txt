We used a primary key (underlined) for each entity as it is the simplest way to identify a record. 
We however used a superkey for the location's primary key as it seems redundant to use an id while you can use a unique combination of attributes such as the street name , street number and the city of the location.

The 'is' relationship denotes inheritance between entities. For example, all storage are locations so we designed our diagram to represent this mother-child link. The 'children' entity are therefore weak entities (double rectangles) as they wouldn't exist without the mother entity. 

The 'in' relationship represents the moves of pieces of arts. The attributes linked to the relationship (day_last_move and target_location) are used to track the moves and respect the given constraints on the moves (at most 1 move per day)
